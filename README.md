## Five Card Draw (Poker Variant)
The goal of this project is to create a two player game using only js, css, and html.

## Motivation
Poker is a beatiful and complex game. There are many variant of poker, but the fundamental is the same.
We've decided to create the simpliest variant of poker which is the Five Card Draw (FCD). FCD is similar
texas holdem, but you are given 5 cards at the beginning, then you bet, then you can switch cards (if you deem applicable), then you bet the final round. FCD is in a sence an easier game because there are fewer betting rounds. But the game mechanics implementation is harder since the player can swap cards.

## Features
FCD is implement with the bet, call, and fold function. This logic is applicable to the standard poker game. Inaddition, card swap is nice to have for future card game. 


## Installation
This game is fully encapsulated and run the web browser.
