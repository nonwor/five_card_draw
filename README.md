## Five Card Draw (Poker Variant)
The goal of this project is to create a two player game using only js, css, and html.

## Motivation
Poker is a beatiful and complex game. There are many variant of poker, but the fundamental is the same.
We've decided to create the simpliest variant of poker which is the Five Card Draw (FCD). FCD is similar
texas holdem, but you are given 5 cards at the beginning, then you bet, then you can switch cards (if you deem applicable), then you bet the final round.
